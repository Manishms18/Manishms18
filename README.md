## 👋 Welcome!  
I am an **Independent Researcher** specializing in **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science**.  
My work emphasizes:  
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** – advancing trust and interpretability in ML models.  
- **Agentic AI Systems** – resilient orchestration of multi-agent workflows.  
- **Forecasting & Optimization** – leakage-free pipelines for aviation, energy, retail, and healthcare.  

I aim to bridge **theory and practice**, making AI systems **transparent, impactful, and socially responsible**.
